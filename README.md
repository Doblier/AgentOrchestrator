# Agent Orchestrator

AgentOrchestrator is an open‑source, production‑grade tool for deploying and orchestrating agentic applications on any container platform—whether in the cloud, on‑premises, or via serverless containers. Inspired by the robust capabilities of platforms like LangGraph Cloud, AgentOrchestrator offers:

- **Persistence & Data Storage:** Supports both short‑term and long‑term memory via integrated databases and caching.
- **Human‑in‑the‑Loop (HITL):** Easily pause and resume workflows with manual intervention.
- **Observability & Self‑Healing:** Built‑in logging, metrics, and error recovery mechanisms for production‑grade reliability.
- **Inter‑Agent Communication:** Seamless protocols to enable collaboration between agents, APIs, and human operators.

## Features

- **Unified Deployment CLI:** Build, containerize, and deploy agentic workflows with a single command.
- **Modular Architecture:** Easily extend or integrate with other agentic frameworks (e.g., LangGraph, CrewAI).
- **State Management:** Persistent state storage and checkpointing for context‑aware interactions.
- **Scalability:** Support for docker‑compose for local development and Kubernetes for scalable production deployments.
- **Extensible Monitoring:** Integrate with Prometheus, Grafana, and other observability tools.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker and docker‑compose installed on your development machine.
- Python 3.12 or later.
- Familiarity with container orchestration and basic DevOps practices.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/panaversity/AgentOrchestrator.git
   cd AgentOrchestrator
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate

    ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
      pip install -r requirements.txt

### Usage
- Build the Docker Image:

    ```bash
      agent-orchestrator build --image-tag agent-orchestrator:latest      
    ```

- Deploy Locally with docker‑compose:

    ```bash
      docker-compose up -d
    ```

- Deploy to Kubernetes:
Use the provided Kubernetes YAML templates in the k8s/ directory:

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml
    ```

- Configure HITL & Monitoring:
Customize environment variables in the .env file for database connections, API keys, and monitoring endpoints.

## Roadmap
- Short‑Term:
  - Finalize CLI and container build routines.
  - Add support for local state management and HITL interfaces.
  - Build comprehensive unit and integration tests.

- Long‑Term:
  - Extend support to additional agentic frameworks (e.g., CrewAI).
  - Integrate with managed container orchestration (Kubernetes, serverless).
  - Enhance observability with native Prometheus metrics and Grafana dashboards.
