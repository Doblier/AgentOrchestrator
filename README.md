**AORBIT**: A powerful, production-grade framework for deploying AI agents with enterprise-grade security - perfect for financial applications and sensitive data processing.

## üöÄ Quick Start (5 minutes)

### Local Development

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/AORBIT.git
cd AORBIT

# Set up environment with UV
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
uv pip install -e .

# Set up your .env file (copy from example)
cp .env.example .env

# Run the server
python main.py
```

Your server is now running at http://localhost:8000! üéâ

### Using Docker (even faster)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/AORBIT.git
cd AORBIT

# Windows PowerShell
.\scripts\run_environments.ps1 -Environment dev -Build

# Linux/macOS
./scripts/run_environments.sh dev --build
```

The development environment will be available at http://localhost:8000.

## ü§ñ Create Your First Agent (2 minutes)

1. Create a new directory in `src/routes/my_first_agent/`
2. Create a file `ao_agent.py` with this template:

```python
from typing import Dict, Any
from langgraph.func import entrypoint, task
from langchain_google_genai import ChatGoogleGenerativeAI

model = ChatGoogleGenerativeAI(model="gemini-2.0-flash-exp")

@task
def generate_greeting(name: str) -> str:
    response = model.invoke(f"Generate a friendly greeting for {name}")
    return response.content

@entrypoint()
def run_workflow(name: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    greeting = generate_greeting(name).result()
    return {"greeting": greeting, "name": name}
```

3. Test your agent:
```
GET http://localhost:8000/api/v1/agent/my_first_agent?input=John
```

That's it! Your first AI agent is up and running.

## üîí Enterprise Security Framework

AORBIT includes a comprehensive enterprise-grade security framework designed for financial applications:

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Fine-grained permission management with hierarchical roles
- **Comprehensive Audit Logging**: Immutable audit trail for all system activities
- **Data Encryption**: Both at-rest and in-transit encryption for sensitive data
- **API Key Management**: Enhanced API keys with role assignments and IP restrictions

To enable the security framework, simply set the following in your `.env` file:

```
SECURITY_ENABLED=true
```

For detailed information, see the [Security Framework Documentation](docs/security_framework.md).

## üê≥ Running Different Environments

AORBIT supports multiple environments through Docker:

```bash
# Windows PowerShell
# Development environment (hot-reloading)
.\scripts\run_environments.ps1 -Environment dev

# Testing environment (runs tests)
.\scripts\run_environments.ps1 -Environment test

# UAT environment (pre-production)
.\scripts\run_environments.ps1 -Environment uat

# Production environment
.\scripts\run_environments.ps1 -Environment prod

# Linux/macOS
# Development environment (hot-reloading)
./scripts/run_environments.sh dev

# Testing environment (runs tests)
./scripts/run_environments.sh test

# UAT environment (pre-production)
./scripts/run_environments.sh uat

# Production environment
./scripts/run_environments.sh prod
```

Access environments at:
- Development: http://localhost:8000
- UAT: http://localhost:8001
- Production: http://localhost:8000

For more details, see the [Docker Environments Guide](docs/docker_environments.md).
